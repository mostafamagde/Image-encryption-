upper bound complexity of encryption and decryption steps: 
It's bounded by O(K N^2) where K is the register length and N is the image width/height Thanks and best regards
3. Image compression using Huffman

Coding with priority queue Time: should be bounded by O(N2 + C log(C)), N is one image dimension (width/height). C is the number of distinct values

4. Image decompression using Huffman

Coding Time: should be bounded by O(N2), N is one image dimension (width/height)

5. Save and load the binary encoded and

compressed file Time: should be bounded by O(N2), N is one image dimension (width/height)
